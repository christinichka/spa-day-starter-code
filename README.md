# spa-day-starter-code

This is a project I made as a student to learn how to combine Java, Thymeleaf, Spring, etc. Spa Day is a system that allows a user to create an account that will recommend what type of treatments are recommended for their skin type. 

The different branches represent a different level of access and for ability. 

starter-master branch:
Displays the user’s name and skin type under their customer profile.
Displays the appropriate facial treatments for their skin type.
Displays the description of the spa’s manicures or pedicures depending on the user’s interest.

If provided, the email has the format of a valid email address.
The password is at least 6 characters long
Form submission is validated
